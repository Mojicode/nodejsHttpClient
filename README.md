# nodejsHttpClient

contain async and sync way to get the http request response.

## async request
Async is nodejs normal way, such as nodejs original API http, I use request module; 

## sync request
Sync is not support by the original nodejs. I use sync-request module.
It is different with async module or (async-await) way. It return response directly, do not have to use promis or callback.
